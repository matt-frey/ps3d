PS3D was originally developed to solve the Euler equations for an incompressible inviscid flow in a horizontally-
periodic domain and confined between parallel free-slip (including shear) surfaces. We especially targeted the
solution of Beltrami flows. Since version 0.0.7, PS3D is also able to simulate buoyancy-driven turbulent flows.
